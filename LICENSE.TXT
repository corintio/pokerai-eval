The work of pokerai.org members
=============================================================================
The work of various PokerAI.org members
(in this thread: http://pokerai.org/pf3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=16):
* Indiana
* Spears
* Adrian20XX 
* Timmy 
and others was used in modifying and assembling the codebase. All of that 
is made available under GPL v2 or later.

Steve Brecher's evaluator and poker code
=============================================================================

Steve Brecher made his code available in the public domain:
http://www.stevebrecher.com/Software/software.html

From his website:
"Hold�Em Showdown and its source code are in the public domain (not copyrighted). 
You are free to give a copy to anyone."

As part of this distribution, however, it is published under GPL v2 or later. 
You can still obtain the original codebase from the author's website.

=============================================================================
Ray Wooten (TwoPlusTwo) poker evaluator and Cactus Kev
=============================================================================

The Ray Wooten, twoplustwo, and all derivations of it are made available 
through GPL v2 or later, based on the following:

(See http://pokerai.org/pf3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1451)

1) mykey1961 claimed that he first came with the idea of LUT-based 7-cards
hand evaluator, and that he makes this available in the public domain.

2) RayW posted his code on 2+2 udner GPL:
// HandRankSetup.cpp : Sets up the HandRank File for VERY fast Lookups
// by Ray Wotton and the 2+2 list My code is GPL, use it as you like
(see http://archives1.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Cat=0&Number=8513906&page=0&fpart=13&vc=1)

As RayW used Cactus Kev
(Cactus Kev's Eval Routine ref http://www.suffecool.net/poker/evaluator.html)
in his original work, and the resulting code was published and made
available under GPL, and stayed in the public domain without any complains,
we believe that the Cactus Kev code is hence made available under GPL. 

As a result, we make all of the code as part of this distribution 
available under GPL.

JPoker library
=============================================================================
We have contacted Andrew Plock to clarify if he can give us permission to 
distribute jpoker library (http://www.pokerstove.com/download/jpoker.tar.gz)
as part of this archive under GPL v2 or later.

As we do not have permission yet, the closest applicable license is the 
one for pokerstove:
http://www.pokerstove.com/download/license.php

which however explicitely states that it applies to pokerstoves only, and 
that the software can only be distributed completely unmodified.
